# SQLAlchemyGrate SQLAlcheMygrate SQLAlcheMyGrate

This is my silly (yet effective) migration framework built on [SQLAlchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org/)â€”the best database abstraction library in the universe. Grate doesn't do fancy things like track schema versions and do step-through upgrade/downgrade paths or testing. Buuut, you can create a wrapper around it to do all these things using the ``upgrade`` command.

One thing grate does well out of the box is a stupid row-by-row re-insert from one SQLAlchemy target engine to another. This means you can make changes to your SQLAlchemy schema as you please, then to port your data you create another database and do a row-by-row re-insert from the old dataset into the new. You can even provide a conversion function that will transform the data when necessary.

**Warning*: Consider this beta quality. There is a lack of error checking so you may get rogue exceptions raised. More features and helpers are being added.*

## Usage

    Usage: grate COMMAND [ARGS ...]

    Really silly schema migration framework, built for SQLAlchemy.

    Commands:
        migrate ENGINE_FROM ENGINE_TO
            Migrate schema or data from one engine to another.

        upgrade ENGINE UPGRADE_FN
            Perform in-place upgrade of a schema in an engine.

    Examples:
        grate migrate "mysql://foo:bar@localhost/baz" "sqlite:///:memory:" \
            --metadata model.meta:metadata --verbose

        grate upgrade "mysql://foo:bar@localhost/baz" migration.001_change_fancy_column:upgrade

    Hint: The upgrade command can also be used to downgrade, just point it
    to the relevant downgrade function. For extra awesomeness, use schema-altering
    DDLs provided by sqlalchemy-migrate.


    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output. Use twice to enable debug
                            output.
      --show-sql            Echo SQLAlchemy queries.

      migrate:
        --only-tables=TABLES
                            Only perform migration on the given tables. (comma-
                            separated table names)
        --skip-tables=TABLES
                            Skip migration on the given tables. (comma-separated
                            table names)
        --limit=LIMIT       Number to select per insert loop. (default: 100000)
        --metadata=METADATA
                            MetaData object bound to the target schema definition.
                            Example: model.metadata:MetaData
        --convert=FN        (Optional) Convert function to run data through.
                            Example: migration.v1:convert


## Function examples

### convert

When migrating, you can provide a conversion function to funnel data through. Here's what one could look like:

    # migration/v1.py:

    def convert(table, row):
        """
        :param table: SQLAlchemy table schema object.
        :param row: Current row from the given table (immutable, must make a copy to change).

        Returns a dict with column:value mappings.
        """
        if table.name == 'user':
            row = dict(row)
            row['email'] = row['email'].lower()
        elif table.name == 'job':
            row = dict(row)
            del row['useless_column']

        return row

Then we would use this function with ``--convert=migration.v1:convert``. There's pretty obvious performance detriment from using this feature, namely having to run each row through a function with its own logic, but with small datasets it's not too bad and too convenient to ignore.


### upgrade

When performing an upgrade command, you can do in-place changes without a full re-insert. This is a more realistic alternative to larger datasets or small schema changes.

    # migration/001_change_fancy_column.py:

    from sqlalchemy import *
    from migrate import * # sqlalchemy-migrate lets us do dialect-agnostic schema changes

    # sqlalchemygrate also provides some helpers just in case
    from grate.migrations import table_migrate

    def upgrade(metadata):
        """
        :param metadata: SQLAlchemy MetaData bound to an engine and autoreflected.
        """
        fancy_table = metadata.tables['fancy_table']

        # TODO: Code a real example here
        # ... Do stuff with fancy_table

        metadata.bind.execute(...)

        # Need to do a row-by-row re-insert? Use the table_migrate helper
        table_migrate(e1, e1, table, renamed_table, convert_fn=my_fn, limit=100000)

    def downgrade(metadata):
        # TODO: Same idea, but backwards!
        pass

This feature becomes *even more powerful* if you combine it with [sqlalchemy-migrate](http://packages.python.org/sqlalchemy-migrate/). This way you can use dialect-agnostic SQLAlchemy DDLs to generate your schema changes, but without having to depend on sqlalchemy-migrate's revision tracking and other needless complexities which drove me to write this.

And now we can upgrade and downgrade our schema, for example:

    grate upgrade "sqlite:///development.db" migration.001_change_fancy_column:upgrade
    grate upgrade "sqlite:///development.db" migration.001_change_fancy_column:downgrade

Maybe this should be called something other than ``upgrade``? Perhaps ``grade``? Anyways...

# ISN'T THIS GRATE?
